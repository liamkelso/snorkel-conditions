# Snorkel Conditions

Snorkel Conditions is a responsive web application that aggregates real-time NOAA tide predictions and OpenWeather API data to help users determine if there are good conditions for snorkeling. The application integrates Google Maps for interactive location selection and uses Chart.js to visualize tide charts. Users can register, sign in, and save their favorite snorkeling spots for quick reference.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data:** Aggregates up-to-date tide predictions and weather information to help you plan your snorkeling adventures.
- **Interactive Map:** Select your desired location via Google Maps—the map automatically adjusts its zoom to show the three closest tide stations.
- **Detailed Overlays:** Click on any tide station marker or station name to open a detailed modal that displays current conditions, tide forecasts, and an hourly forecast table.
- **User Authentication & Favorites:** Register, sign in, and manage your favorite snorkeling spots with custom notes.
- **Responsive & Accessible:** Designed to work seamlessly across devices, with keyboard accessibility and ARIA labels to enhance the user experience.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Features custom gradients, subtle animations, micro‑interactions (like button ripple effects and hover effects), and a polished two‑column modal layout.
